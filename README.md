# Ragnarok

This is a flavour and retheme for royalty to have more of a viking/Ragnar√∂k flavour to it, intended for use only with the Mr Samuel Streamer [twilight modpack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3269400350), wouldn't really make sense otherwise. Not recommended for use in any other situation.

Features:

- All maps spawn with the "World Tree", an anima nexus re-theme that provides sunlamp type effects in maps of otherwise total darkness
- Partly implemented Anomaly rename/re-theme to be more viking centric
- Partly implemented anima weapons and resources (anima wood, anima sap)
- Partly implemented misc features, such as Odin's ravens

## Contributors

- Vast swaths of half-working XML and anima weapons and resource art by Mr Samuel Streamer
